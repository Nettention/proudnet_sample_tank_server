## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
1. Copy ProudNet files from your ProudNet installation location to create a `ProudNet/` directory at the same level as `tank_server/`
2. Verify that `ProudNet/util/PIDL.exe` exists for protocol compilation

### 1. C# Server Implementation

#### Step 1: Understanding the Protocol Definition (Tank.PIDL)
The `Tank.PIDL` file defines the communication protocol between server and client:

```pidl
// Tank.PIDL - Protocol Interface Definition Language
global Tank 2000 // Client-Server and Server-Client RMI, first message ID = 2000
{
    // Client to Server functions
    SendMove([in] float posX, [in] float posY, [in] float direction);
    SendFire([in] int shooterId, [in] float direction, [in] float launchForce, ...);
    SendTankType([in] int tankType);
    
    // Server to Client functions  
    OnPlayerJoined([in] int clientId, [in] float posX, [in] float posY, [in] int tankType);
    OnTankPositionUpdated([in] int clientId, [in] float posX, [in] float posY, [in] float direction);
    OnSpawnBullet([in] int clientId, [in] int shooterId, ...);
    // ... more RMI functions
}
```

This PIDL file defines:
- **RMI functions** sent from Client to Server (SendMove, SendFire, etc.)
- **RMI functions** sent from Server to Client (OnPlayerJoined, OnTankPositionUpdated, etc.)
- **P2P messaging** for direct client communication

#### Step 2: Generate C# Stub and Proxy Classes
Run the PIDL compiler to generate C# networking code:

```bash
cd tank_server/Common
CompilePIDL_cs.bat
```

**Expected Output:**
```
C:\Users\wayne\Documents\proud_tank\tank_server\Common [master +5 ~14 -15 !]> .\CompilePIDL_cs.bat 
PIDL compile complete!
Press any key to continue . . . 
```

This script will:
- Execute `ProudNet/util/PIDL.exe -cs Tank.PIDL -outdir ../Server`
- Execute `ProudNet/util/PIDL.exe -cs Tank.PIDL -outdir ../Client`
- Generate files in both Server and Client directories:
  - `Tank_stub.cs` - Handles incoming RMI calls
  - `Tank_proxy.cs` - Sends outgoing RMI calls  
  - `Tank_common.cs` - Common definitions and constants

#### Step 3: Build the Server
Navigate to the Server directory and build:

```bash
cd tank_server/Server
build.bat
```

**Expected Output:**
```
C:\Users\wayne\Documents\proud_tank\tank_server\Server [master +15 ~13 -15 !]> ./build.bat

========================================

Output directory: bin\Debug\net9.0
You can now run the Tank Server executable.

Press any key to continue . . .
```

The build script will:
- Compile the C# project using `dotnet build --configuration Debug`
- Copy required ProudNet DLLs to the output directory:
  - `ProudDotNetServer.dll`, `ProudDotNetClient.dll`
  - `ProudNetServer.dll`, `ProudNetServerPlugin.dll`
  - `libcrypto-3-x64.dll`, `libssl-3-x64.dll`

#### Step 4: Run the Server
```bash
cd tank_server/Server/bin/Debug/net9.0
TankServer.exe
```

**Expected Output:**
```
C:\Users\wayne\Documents\proud_tank\tank_server\Server [master +5 ~14 -15 !]> .\bin\Debug\net9.0\TankServer.exe      
Tank Server started on port 33334
Server is running. Commands:
status: Show connected clients
health [id]: Show tank health (all or specific ID)
damage id amount: Apply damage to a tank
heal id amount: Heal a tank
respawn id x y: Respawn a tank at position (x,y)
q: Quit server
Client 3 connected
New tank created for client 3 with tank type -1 and health 100/100
Not enough clients to create P2P group (need at least 2)
```

The server will:
- Start listening on port 33334
- Display connection status and game events
- Accept commands: `status`, `health`, `damage`, `heal`, `respawn`, `q` (quit)

### 2. C# Client Implementation

#### Step 1: Shared Protocol Understanding
The client uses the **same Tank.PIDL file** as the server, ensuring perfect protocol compatibility:

- **Same RMI definitions**: Both server and client understand identical function signatures
- **Shared stub/proxy classes**: The `CompilePIDL_cs.bat` script generates identical networking code for both projects
- **Protocol synchronization**: Any changes to Tank.PIDL automatically update both server and client when recompiled

This approach guarantees that:
- Server and client always use compatible network protocols
- RMI function calls are type-safe and validated at compile time
- Network message format is consistent between both applications

#### Step 2: Build the Client
Navigate to the Client directory and build:

```bash
cd tank_server/Client  
build.bat
```

**Expected Output:**
```
C:\Users\wayne\Documents\proud_tank\tank_server\Client [master +5 ~14 -15 !]> .\build.bat

========================================

Output directory: bin\Debug\net9.0
You can now run the Tank Client executable.

Press any key to continue . . .
```

The client build script performs the same operations as the server:
- Compiles the C# project using `dotnet build --configuration Debug`
- Copies the same ProudNet DLLs to ensure runtime compatibility
- Uses the generated stub/proxy classes from the PIDL compilation

#### Step 3: Run the Client
```bash
cd tank_server/Client/bin/Debug/net9.0
TankClient.exe
```

**Expected Output:**
```
C:\Users\wayne\Documents\proud_tank\tank_server\Client [master +6 ~14 -15 !]> .\bin\Debug\net9.0\TankClient.exe
Connecting to server...
Commands:
move x y dir : Move tank to position (x,y) with direction dir
fire dir [force] : Fire in direction dir with optional force (default 25.0)
tank n       : Select tank type (0-3)
health h [max]: Update tank health to h with optional max health
destroy [id] : Send tank destroyed event (id of destroyer, default 0 = environment)
spawn x y dir type health: Spawn/respawn tank
msg text     : Send P2P message to other clients
history      : Show message history
status       : Show P2P connection status
auto         : Toggle auto movement
q            : Quit
Connected to server. My ID: 3
```

**🔍 Check Server Connection:**
When the client successfully connects, you should also see a connection message on the **server console**:

**Server Console Output:**
```
C:\Users\wayne\Documents\proud_tank\tank_server\Server [master +5 ~14 -15 !]> .\bin\Debug\net9.0\TankServer.exe
Tank Server started on port 33334
Server is running. Commands:
status: Show connected clients
health [id]: Show tank health (all or specific ID)
damage id amount: Apply damage to a tank
heal id amount: Heal a tank
respawn id x y: Respawn a tank at position (x,y)
q: Quit server
Client 3 connected
New tank created for client 3 with tank type -1 and health 100/100
Not enough clients to create P2P group (need at least 2)
```

**📝 Server Log Explanation:**
- `Client 3 connected` - A new client has successfully connected and been assigned ID 3
- `New tank created for client 3 with tank type -1 and health 100/100` - Server creates a tank object for the new client:
  - Tank type `-1` means no tank type selected yet
  - Initial health is set to 100/100 (current/maximum)
- `Not enough clients to create P2P group (need at least 2)` - P2P group creation requires at least 2 clients for peer-to-peer communication

**💡 To test P2P functionality:**
Run a **second client** in another terminal to see:

**Second Client Output:**
```

Not enough clients to create P2P group (need at least 2)
Client 4 connected
New tank created for client 4 with tank type -1 and health 100/100
Sending existing player info to new client: ID=3, Type=-1, Health=100/100
Notifying existing client 3 about new player: ID=4, Type=-1, Health=100/100
P2P group created with 2 members, Group ID: 5
Sent P2P group info to client 3: P2P_GROUP_INFO:5
Sent P2P group info to client 4: P2P_GROUP_INFO:5
```

**📝 Multi-Client Connection Analysis:**

**When the second client connects:**
1. **Client 4 connects** - Server assigns new ID and creates tank object
2. **Player synchronization** - Server exchanges player information:
   - Sends existing player info (Client 3) to the new client (Client 4)
   - Notifies existing client (Client 3) about the new player (Client 4)
3. **P2P group creation** - Now that there are 2+ clients:
   - Server creates P2P group with ID 5
   - Both clients receive P2P group information
   - Clients can now communicate directly via P2P messaging

**Client-side P2P events:**
- `P2P: Member X joined group Y` - P2P group membership notifications
- `OnPlayerJoined: Tank 3 joined at (x,y)` - Receives info about existing players
- `OnTankHealthUpdated: Tank 3 health: 100/100` - Receives health status of other tanks
- `P2P: Received group info, Group ID: 5` - Confirms P2P group setup

**🎮 Now you can test multiplayer features:**
- Use `msg hello` in one client to send P2P messages to others
- Use `move x y dir` to see position updates across clients  
- Use `fire dir` to test projectile synchronization

### 3. C++ Server Implementation (Optional)

The C++ server implementation provides the **exact same functionality** as the C# server, offering cross-platform support and containerized deployment options. This is an optional advanced implementation that demonstrates ProudNet's multi-language capabilities.

#### Protocol Compatibility
Since both C# and C++ servers use the **same Tank.PIDL file**, they are fully compatible:
- **Same RMI functions**: Identical network protocol definitions
- **Client compatibility**: C# clients can connect to either C# or C++ servers seamlessly
- **Feature parity**: Movement, firing, P2P messaging, and all game mechanics work identically

#### Key Advantages of C++ Implementation
- **Cross-platform support**: Runs on Windows, Linux, and containerized environments
- **Performance optimization**: Native C++ performance for high-load scenarios
- **Production deployment**: Docker containerization for scalable server infrastructure
- **Linux compatibility**: Deploy on Ubuntu/Linux servers without .NET dependencies

#### Step 1: Generate C++ Stub and Proxy Classes
First, generate the C++ networking code from the PIDL file:

```bash
cd tank_server/Common
CompilePIDL_cpp.bat
```

**Expected Output:**
```
C:\Users\wayne\Documents\proud_tank\tank_server\Common [master +5 ~14 -15 !]> .\CompilePIDL_cpp.bat
[INFO] Generating C++ files from Tank.PIDL...
[INFO] PIDL C++ compilation complete!
[INFO] Generated files in ..\Server_CPP\include directory.
Press any key to continue . . . 
```

This will generate C++ stub/proxy classes in the `Server_CPP/include/` directory:
- `Tank_stub.cpp/.h` - Handles incoming RMI calls
- `Tank_proxy.cpp/.h` - Sends outgoing RMI calls
- `Tank_common.cpp/.h` - Common definitions and constants

#### Step 2: Build the C++ Server (Windows)

##### Prerequisites for Windows Build
Before building the C++ server, ensure you have the following components installed:

**Required Software:**
- **Visual Studio 2022** (Community/Professional/Enterprise)
  - Also supports VS 2019, 2017, 2015
- **CMake 3.10 or higher**
- **Windows SDK 10.0** (latest version recommended)

**Required Visual Studio Components:**
When installing Visual Studio, make sure to include these workloads and components:
- **Desktop development with C++** workload
- **MSVC v143 - VS 2022 C++ x64/x86 build tools** (latest)
- **Windows 11 SDK** (or Windows 10 SDK)
- **ATL for v143 build tools (x86 & x64)** - *Required for ProudNet linking*
- **CMake tools for C++**
- **Git for Windows** (optional, for version control)

**Important Note about ATL:**
The Active Template Library (ATL) is essential for ProudNet linking on Windows. In CMakeLists.txt, you can see it's explicitly linked:
```cmake
target_link_libraries(TankGameServer
    # ... other libraries ...
    atls       # ATL library addition
)
```

##### Build Process
Navigate to the Server_CPP directory and build using the provided script:

```bash
cd tank_server/Server_CPP
build.bat
```

**Expected Build Output:**
```

```bash
cd tank_server/Server_CPP
run.bat
```

**Expected Server Output:**
```
C:\Users\wayne\Documents\proud_tank\tank_server\Server_CPP [master +5 ~14 -15 !]> .\run.bat
[INFO] Starting TankGameServer C++ Server...
[INFO] Found executable at build\TankServer.exe (NMake build
[INFO] Server is starting. Press 'q' to quit.
[INFO] Running: C:\Users\wayne\Documents\proud_tank\tank_server\Server_CPP\build\TankServer.exe
========== Tank Server Started ==========
TCP Server listening on 0.0.0.0:33334
WebSocket Server listening on 0.0.0.0:33335/ws
Ready to accept connections from all network interfaces
==========================================
Server is running. Commands:
status: Show connected clients
health [id]: Show tank health (all or specific ID)
damage id amount: Apply damage to a tank
heal id amount: Heal a tank
respawn id x y: Respawn a tank at position (x,y)
q: Quit server
```

**Server Startup Analysis:**
1. **Executable Detection**: `run.bat` automatically locates the built executable
2. **Network Binding**: Server binds to all network interfaces (0.0.0.0)
   - **TCP Server**: Port 33334 for game connections
   - **WebSocket Server**: Port 33335/ws for web client support
3. **Command Interface**: Same server commands as C# version
4. **Ready State**: Server is ready to accept client connections

#### Step 4: C# Client Compatibility Test

**🔄 Protocol Compatibility Verification:**
The C++ server is fully compatible with the existing C# clients. You can connect the **same C# clients** from Step 2 to this C++ server without any modifications.

**Connect C# Client to C++ Server:**
```bash
# In another terminal, run the C# client
cd tank_server/Client/bin/Debug/net9.0
TankClient.exe
```

**C++ Server Console Log (Client Connection):**
```
Client 3 connected from 127.0.0.1:52341
New tank created for client 3 with tank type -1 and health 100/100
Not enough clients to create P2P group (need at least 2)
```


**Server Log Analysis:**
1. **Identical Client Processing**: C++ server handles client connections exactly like C# server
2. **Same Tank Creation**: Creates tank objects with identical initial state (health 100/100, type -1)
3. **Player Synchronization**: Exchanges player information between clients identically
4. **P2P Group Management**: Creates P2P groups with same logic and group ID assignment
5. **Protocol Compatibility**: All RMI functions and message formats work seamlessly

**✅ Complete Functional Parity:**
- All movement, firing, and messaging commands work identically
- P2P group creation and management function the same
- Server commands (`status`, `health`, `damage`, `heal`, `respawn`) work identically
- Client connection handling and state management are identical
- Tank creation, health tracking, and game logic are exactly the same

**🎯 This demonstrates that the C++ server is a complete drop-in replacement for the C# server with 100% protocol compatibility.**

#### Step 5: Docker Deployment (Linux/Ubuntu)

The C++ server can be deployed as a Docker container on Ubuntu 24.04 for production environments.

##### Prerequisites for Docker Deployment
- **Docker Desktop** (Windows) or **Docker Engine** (Linux)
- **Docker Compose** for orchestration

##### Windows Docker Setup
If running on Windows, ensure Docker is configured for Linux containers:

1. **Install Docker Desktop** from the official website
2. **Switch to Linux containers**:
   - Right-click Docker Desktop system tray icon
   - Select "Switch to Linux containers..."
   - Wait for Docker to restart in Linux container mode

##### ProudNet License Configuration (Optional)

By default, the server runs in **50 CCU limitation mode** without a license key. For production deployment with unlimited concurrent users, you can configure a ProudNet license:

1. **License Key Setup**

Edit the `tank_server/licensekey.txt` file:

```bash
# Default content (50 CCU limitation): Replace with your actual ProudNet license key:
PUT_YOUR_PROUDNET_LICENSE_KEY_HERE
```


2. **License Verification**

The Docker build process automatically detects and applies the license:
- **With License**: Unlimited CCU, full ProudNet features
- **Without License**: 50 CCU limitation, development mode

**Expected Docker Output with License:**
```
tank-server-1  | License key found: /app/licensekey.txt
tank-server-1  | ProudNet license validation successful
tank-server-1  | Starting server with full license (unlimited CCU)
```

**Expected Docker Output without License (Default):**
```
tank-server-1  | License key file not found: /app/licensekey.txt
tank-server-1  | Building without ProudNet license.
tank-server-1  | Starting server without license (50 CCU limitation mode).
```

**🔑 License Benefits:**
- **Increased CCU**: Higher concurrent connection limits based on license type
- **Production Features**: Full ProudNet server capabilities
- **Technical Support**: Access to ProudNet technical support
- **Performance Optimization**: Enhanced server performance features

##### Docker Deployment Commands

```bash
cd tank_server/Server_CPP
docker-compose up
```

**Expected Docker Output:**
```
C:\Users\wayne\Documents\proud_tank\tank_server\Server_CPP [master +5 ~14 -15 !]> docker-compose up
Compose can now delegate builds to bake for better performance.
 To do so, set COMPOSE_BAKE=true.

```bash
# In another terminal, run the C# client
cd tank_server/Client/bin/Debug/net9.0
TankClient.exe
```

**Expected Client Connection:**
```
Connected to server. My ID: 3
```

**Expected Docker Server Log:**
```
tank-server-cpp  | Client 3 connected from 172.17.0.1:52341
tank-server-cpp  | New tank created for client 3 with tank type -1 and health 100/100
```

- **No Installation Required**: Players can join games instantly through any modern web browser

**Connection Example:**
```
ws://localhost:33335/ws  // Local development
ws://your-server.com:33335/ws  // Production deployment
```

This dual-protocol architecture enables seamless integration between traditional desktop applications and modern web-based gaming platforms.

### 4. Multiplayer Movement Testing

This section demonstrates a real-world scenario where two clients connect simultaneously and test tank movement functionality.

#### Test Scenario
- **Client 1 (ID=3)**: Uses `move 1 1 0` command to move to position (1,1) with direction 0 degrees
- **Client 2 (ID=4)**: Uses `move 2 2 90` command to move to position (2,2) with direction 90 degrees

#### Client 1 (ID=3) Console Log:
```
Connected to server. My ID: 3
move 1 1 0
Status: Tank ID=3, Position=(1,1), Type=0, Health=100/100
OnPlayerJoined: Tank 4 joined at (64.18131,34.385406) with tank type -1
P2P: Member 3 joined group 5
P2P: Member 4 joined group 5
P2P: Added member 4 to group member list
OnTankHealthUpdated: Tank 4 health: 100/100
P2P: Received group info, Group ID: 5
>>> OTHER TANK 4 MOVED TO (2,2) dir=90
```

**Client 1 Log Analysis:**
1. **Self Movement Processing**: After executing `move 1 1 0` command, own tank status is updated
2. **New Player Detection**: Receives `OnPlayerJoined` event when Client 4 connects to server
3. **P2P Group Formation**: P2P group (ID: 5) is created when 2+ clients are connected
4. **Other Tank Movement Notification**: Receives Client 4's movement in real-time and displays it

#### Client 2 (ID=4) Console Log:
```
Connected to server. My ID: 4
P2P: Member 4 joined group 5
P2P: Member 3 joined group 5
P2P: Added member 3 to group member list
OnPlayerJoined: Tank 3 joined at (1,1) with tank type -1
OnTankHealthUpdated: Tank 3 health: 100/100
P2P: Received group info, Group ID: 5
move 2 2 90
Status: Tank ID=4, Position=(2,2), Type=0, Health=100/100
```

**Client 2 Log Analysis:**
1. **Server Connection**: Successfully connected to server and assigned ID 4
2. **P2P Group Participation**: Joins P2P group 5 together with existing Client 3
3. **Existing Player Info Reception**: Receives tank information (position, health) of already connected Client 3
4. **Self Movement Execution**: Uses `move 2 2 90` command to move tank to position (2,2) with 90-degree direction

#### Server Console Log:
```
New tank created for client 4 with tank type -1 and health 100/100
Sending existing player info to new client: ID=3, Type=-1, Health=100/100
Notifying existing client 3 about new player: ID=4, Type=-1, Health=100/100
P2P group created with 2 members, Group ID: 5
Sent P2P group info to client 3: P2P_GROUP_INFO:5
Sent P2P group info to client 4: P2P_GROUP_INFO:5
SendMove from client 4: pos=(2,2), direction=90
```

**Server Log Analysis:**
1. **New Client Processing**: Creates new tank object for Client 4 (initial health 100/100)
2. **Player Information Synchronization**: 
   - Sends existing player (ID=3) information to new client (ID=4)
   - Notifies existing client (ID=3) about new player (ID=4)
3. **P2P Group Management**: Creates P2P group (ID: 5) when 2+ clients are present and distributes group information
4. **Movement Command Processing**: Receives and processes Client 4's `SendMove` RMI call

#### Core Multiplayer Features Verification:

**🔄 Real-time Synchronization:**
- Movement from one client is immediately propagated to all other clients
- Server manages state centrally and broadcasts to all clients

**🌐 P2P Networking:**
- P2P group is automatically formed when 2+ clients are connected
- Direct client-to-client communication improves network efficiency

**📊 State Management:**
- Position, direction, and health of each tank are synchronized across all clients
- Newly connected clients automatically receive existing game state

**🎮 Game Logic:**
- Tank type, position, and direction are accurately transmitted and displayed
- Each player's actions are reflected in real-time in the multiplayer environment

### 5. Fire and Messaging Testing

In addition to movement, clients can test projectile firing and P2P messaging functionality.

#### Extended Test Commands
- **Fire Command**: `fire 180 10` - Fire projectile in direction 180 degrees with force 10
- **Message Command**: `msg hi` - Send P2P message "hi" to other connected clients

#### Client 1 (ID=3) Fire and Message Commands:
```
fire 180 10
Fire request sent: direction=180, force=10, position=(1, 1, 1)
Status: Tank ID=3, Position=(1,1), Type=0, Health=100/100
msg hi
P2P message sent via server: hi
Status: Tank ID=3, Position=(1,1), Type=0, Health=100/100
```

**Client 1 Command Analysis:**
1. **Fire Command Execution**: `fire 180 10` sends projectile with 180-degree direction and force value 10
2. **Fire Confirmation**: Client receives confirmation with firing position and parameters
3. **Message Command Execution**: `msg hi` sends P2P message to all connected clients
4. **Message Confirmation**: Client receives confirmation that message was sent via server relay

#### Client 2 (ID=4) Receiving Fire and Message Events:
```
OnSpawnBullet: Tank 3 fired from (1,1) dir=180, force=10
Fire position: (1, 1, 1), shooter ID=3
P2P Message from Client ID 3 (relayed): hi
```

**Client 2 Reception Analysis:**
1. **Bullet Spawn Event**: Receives `OnSpawnBullet` RMI call with firing tank's position and projectile parameters
2. **Fire Details**: Gets complete information about shooter ID, position, direction, and force
3. **P2P Message Reception**: Receives the P2P message from Client 3 relayed through the server

#### Key Multiplayer Communication Features:

**🔫 Projectile System:**
- Fire commands are synchronized across all clients in real-time
- Each client receives complete projectile information (position, direction, force, shooter ID)
- Projectile spawn events are properly broadcast to maintain game state consistency

**💬 P2P Messaging:**
- Messages are sent through server relay to ensure delivery
- All connected clients receive messages from any sender
- Message source identification (sender Client ID) is preserved
- Reliable message delivery through ProudNet's P2P infrastructure

**🔄 Event Broadcasting:**
- All game actions (movement, firing, messaging) are immediately propagated
- Consistent game state maintained across all connected clients
- Real-time multiplayer interaction without noticeable delays

### Troubleshooting

- **Build errors**: Ensure ProudNet DLLs are in the correct paths
- **Connection failed**: Check if server is running and firewall settings
