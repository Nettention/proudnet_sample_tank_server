#### Step 2: Verify ProudNet Installation
Check that ProudNet components are properly integrated:

**Sample Assets Installation Verification:**
1. Verify the following folder structure exists:
   ```
   Assets/
   ├── Plugins/
   │   └── ProudNet/           # Contains ProudNet DLLs
   │       ├── ProudNetClientUnity.dll
   │       ├── Andorid/
   │       ├── WebGL/
   │       └── x86_64/
   ├── ProudNet_Demo/          # Demo scene and scripts
   │   ├── DemoScene/
   │   └── ProudNetScripts/
   └── Scripts/
       └── Network/            # Network-related scripts
   ```

**Platform Settings Verification:**
1. Select each DLL in `Assets/Plugins/`
2. In Inspector, verify **Platform settings**:
   - **Windows**: Enabled for x86_64 (Standalone Windows)
   
#### Step 3: Configure Network Settings
Set up basic network configuration for tank game:

**Create Network Configuration:**
1. Right-click in Project window
2. Select **Create > ProudNet > Network Config**
3. Name it `TankNetworkConfig`
4. Configure the following settings:
   - **Server IP**: `127.0.0.1` (localhost for testing)
   - **Server Port**: `33334` (matches tank server port)
   
**Network Configuration Details:**
TankNetworkConfig Connection Settings:
- Server IP: 127.0.0.1
- TCP Port: 33334 (for standalone builds)
- WebSocket Port: 33335 (for WebGL builds, only supported by C++ server)

Note: We will use port 33334 for standalone builds initially. Later for WebGL builds, we'll use the WebSocket port 33335 which is only available in the C++ server implementation (the C# server does not support WebSocket connections).

### 2.5. PIDL Integration Workflow (Optional but Recommended)

If you completed the server setup from the previous documentation, you can reuse the generated PIDL files:

**Option A: Copy from Server Project (Recommended)**
If you have the tank server project available, use the convenience batch script:

```bash
# Navigate to tank_server directory
cd tank_server

# Run the copy script
copy_client_generated_to_unity.bat
```

**What the script does:**
```
Copies from tank_server/:
├── Server/Tank_stub.cs     → unity_tank_client/Assets/Proundnet_Demo/ProudNetScripts/Generated/
├── Server/Tank_proxy.cs    → unity_tank_client/Assets/Proundnet_Demo/ProudNetScripts/Generated/
├── Server/Tank_common.cs   → unity_tank_client/Assets/Proundnet_Demo/ProudNetScripts/Generated/
└── Common/Vars.cs          → unity_tank_client/Assets/Proundnet_Demo/ProudNetScripts/Common/
```

**Expected Output:**
```
===== ProudNet Generated Files Unity Copy Script =====
Copying PIDL generated files...
        1 file(s) copied.
        1 file(s) copied.
        1 file(s) copied.
Copying common files...
        1 file(s) copied.

Copy completed! The following files have been copied to Unity project:
- ..\unity_tank_client\Assets\Proundnet_Demo\ProudNetScripts\Generated\Tank_stub.cs
- ..\unity_tank_client\Assets\Proundnet_Demo\ProudNetScripts\Generated\Tank_proxy.cs
- ..\unity_tank_client\Assets\Proundnet_Demo\ProudNetScripts\Generated\Tank_common.cs
- ..\unity_tank_client\Assets\Proundnet_Demo\ProudNetScripts\Common\Vars.cs

Press any key to continue...
```

**Option B: Manual PIDL Generation (If no server project)**
If you don't have the server project, you would need to:
1. Have access to the `Tank.PIDL` file from the Common folder
2. Run `ProudNet/util/PIDL.exe -cs Tank.PIDL -outdir Generated`
3. Manually copy the generated files to the Unity directories

**Protocol Compatibility Benefits:**
- **Identical Message IDs**: Unity client uses same RMI IDs as server
- **Type Safety**: Compile-time checking of network message parameters  
- **Version Synchronization**: Protocol version automatically matches server
- **Zero Configuration**: No additional network setup required

### 3. Tank Multiplayer Integration

#### Step 1: Network Scripts Overview
The tank Unity client uses a comprehensive networking system built on ProudNet RMI (Remote Method Invocation). Here's the actual script structure:

**Core Network Scripts:**
```
Assets/
├── Scripts/Network/
│   ├── GameNetworkManager.cs     # Main network manager (Singleton)
│   └── NetworkTank.cs           # Individual tank network synchronization
├── Proundnet_Demo/ProudNetScripts/
│   ├── Common/
│   │   └── Vars.cs              # Protocol version and server configuration
│   └── Generated/               # Auto-generated from Tank.PIDL
│       ├── Tank_common.cs       # RMI message IDs and constants
│       ├── Tank_proxy.cs        # Client-to-server RMI calls
│       └── Tank_stub.cs         # Server-to-client RMI handlers
```

**GameNetworkManager.cs - Main Features:**
- **Server Connection Management**: Handles connection to tank server (TCP/WebSocket)
- **P2P Group Management**: Manages peer-to-peer communication groups
- **Tank Lifecycle**: Spawns/destroys local and remote tanks
- **RMI Communication**: Sends/receives tank movement, firing, health updates
- **Chat System**: P2P messaging with other players
- **Multi-platform Support**: Automatic TCP (standalone) vs WebSocket (WebGL) selection

**NetworkTank.cs - Individual Tank Features:**
- **Position Interpolation**: Smooth movement sync for remote tanks  
- **Local Player Control**: WASD movement and firing for your tank
- **Remote Player Rendering**: Displays other players' tanks with network data
- **Health Synchronization**: Real-time health updates across all clients
- **Projectile Sync**: Handles shell firing and impact effects
- **Collision Detection**: Tracks damage from shell explosions

**Generated RMI Classes (from Tank.PIDL):**
- **Tank_proxy.cs**: Methods to send data to server (`SendMove`, `SendFire`, `SendTankHealthUpdated`)
- **Tank_stub.cs**: Handlers to receive data from server (`OnTankPositionUpdated`, `OnSpawnBullet`, `OnPlayerJoined`)
- **Tank_common.cs**: Message IDs and RMI constants shared between client and server

**Important Note:** The files in `Generated/` folder are the **exact same files** generated during the C# server implementation in the previous documentation. This ensures 100% protocol compatibility between the server and Unity client. The Unity client reuses the identical PIDL-generated networking code.

**Key Network Features Implemented:**
- **Real-time Movement Sync**: 20Hz position updates with interpolation
- **Projectile Synchronization**: Shells fired by other players appear instantly
- **Health Management**: Damage and healing synchronized across all clients  
- **P2P Chat System**: Direct messaging between players in the same group
- **Tank Type Selection**: Different tank models synchronized across clients
- **Automatic Reconnection**: Handles network disconnection gracefully

#### Step 2: Open Pre-configured Multiplayer Scene
The Unity tank client includes a pre-configured multiplayer scene with ProudNet integration:

**Open the Network-Ready Scene:**
1. Navigate to `Assets\Proundnet_Demo\DemoScene\`
2. Open `Demo_Networkd_Game_Desert.unity` scene
3. This scene is **already configured** with all necessary networking components

![ProudNet Network Demo Scene](img/image_004.png)
*ProudNet Network Demo Scene - The pre-configured multiplayer tank game scene with networking components and chat system*



#### Step 3: Verify Network Configuration (Optional)
The scene is pre-configured, but you can verify or modify the network settings if needed:

**GameNetworkManager Settings (Already Configured):**
1. Select **GameNetworkManager** GameObject in hierarchy
2. In Inspector, view **GameNetworkManager** component settings:
   - **Server IP**: `127.0.0.1` (localhost for testing)
   - **Server Port**: `33334` (TCP for standalone builds)
   - **WebSocket Port**: `33335` (for WebGL builds only) [Note: This setting is hidden in the inspector for standalone builds but will be used later when building for WebGL]
   - **Auto Connect On Start**: Enabled for automatic connection

![GameNetworkManager Inspector](img/image_005.png)
*GameNetworkManager Inspector - Network configuration settings for server IP, port, and connection options*


**Customization Options:**
- **Server IP**: Change if your server runs on a different machine
- **Ports**: Modify if your server uses different ports
- **Auto Connect**: Disable if you want manual connection control

### 4. Testing Multiplayer Functionality

*WebGL Browser Gameplay - Tank game running in web browser with WebSocket connection and chat functionality*

**Expected WebGL Behavior:**
- **WebSocket Connection**: Connects to tank server via WebSocket (port 33335)
- **Cross-Platform Play**: WebGL clients can play with desktop clients
- **Same Game Logic**: Identical movement, firing, and chat functionality
- **Browser Compatibility**: Works in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge


## Troubleshooting

**Common Issues and Solutions:**

### Connection Issues
- **"Failed to connect to server"**
  - Verify tank server is running and accessible
  - Check firewall settings for ports 33334-33335
  - Confirm server IP address in NetworkManager settings

### ProudNet Integration Issues
- **"ProudNet DLL not found"**
  - Verify DLLs are in `Assets/Plugins/` folder
  - Check platform settings for each DLL file
  - Restart Unity Editor after DLL changes

### Build Issues
- **"Build failed with networking errors"**
  - Ensure all ProudNet scripts compile without errors
  - Check Unity Console for specific error messages
  - Verify platform settings for ProudNet DLLs in Plugins folder:
    - Windows: x86_64 enabled for standalone builds
    - WebGL: WebGL platform enabled for browser builds
    
### WebGL Issues
- **"WebSocket connection failed"**
  - Verify tank server supports WebSocket (port 33335)
  - Check browser console for specific error messages
  - Ensure CORS headers are properly configured on server

- **"Networking not working in Unity Editor with WebGL platform selected"**
  - **Expected Behavior**: ProudNet does not support in-editor play mode for WebGL platform
  - **Solution**: Build the project as WebGL and test in a web browser instead
  - **Alternative**: Switch back to Windows/Mac/Linux Standalone platform for editor testing


**Debugging Tools:**
- **Unity Console**: Network connection and error messages
- **Server Console**: Client connection and game state logs
- **Network Profiler**: Unity's built-in network performance analysis
- **ProudNet Monitor**: Real-time network statistics (if available)

**Getting Help:**
